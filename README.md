# Project Proposal

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the number of people playing computer games on the **Steam** platform at a given date and time. It further aims to predict the ranking of the most played games. The data will be collected using Steam API.

## Goals
- Build a prediction model to estimate the number of players playing different games based on historical player count data.  
- Identify factors that may influence results, such as:  
  - Whether it is a working day or weekend.  
  - Time of day (e.g., after work hours).  
  - Regional time zones. (Unfortunately can not be isolated)
  - Popularity of the game, but using top 20 games will reduce the variance hopefully.
  - Date since its release
- Collect hourly player count data for the top 20 games by number of players in a day from SteamDB, train the model, and use it to make predictions.  

## Data
- **Data Sources:** [SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info) (uses Steam API).  
- **Collection Method:** Download csv files conatining user count per time from the website, scrapping other game specific features from the SteamDB.    
- **Frequency/Timeframe:** Hourly basis, 10minute basis for data from 10/14 to 10/20.  
- **Scope:** Focus on the top 20 games by player count in terms of current players on October 20th.
- **Name of Games:** Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, PUBG: Battlegrounds, APEX Legends, Delta Force, Rust, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT, Banana, Bongo Cat, Stardew Valley, Megabonk, Marvel Rivals, Grand Theft Auto V, Warframe, Baldur's Gate 3, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Team Fortress 2, Dead by Daylight, DayZ, Call of Duty
- **Contents:**
  - Game.csv containing game related features
  - Weekend.csv maps dates to indicator variable
  - 20 csv files whose name is the name of the game, contains hourly player count from 09/20-10/20

## Data Cleaning:##
- Using UTC for any time related data
- Cropped data before September 20th to focus on recent month as a training set.

## Feature Extraction
- Features extracted for Game.csv:  
  - Name of Game.  
  - Genre(1 if it is a clicker game, 0 otherwise). Specifically chosen Clicker games since they encourage player to turn the game on even if they are Idle, contributing to player count.  
  - Release date.  
  - Price in US Dollar, 0 if available free.    
- Features extracted for Weekend.csv:
  - Date
  - Indicator variable(1 if Friday or Weekend, 0 Otherwise). Holidays are not accounted due to global distribution of players, may bias towards certain regions.  
- Features extracted for GameName.csv:
  - Date (MM/DD)
  - Time (HH/MM/SS)
  - Player Count

## Modeling Plan
We will experiment with several approaches, including:  
- Regression-based models.  
- Subject to change as we learn more advanced models.  

We will evaluate model performance and select the best one based on accuracy and interpretability.  

## Visualization of the data
- Visualization of Hourly player counts data is available at /notebook/Interactive_Plot.ipynb
- Any code that is used in the notebook is present in /src.

## Test Plan
- **Training set:** Data from September 20th â€“ October 20th.  
- **Test set:** Reserve data starting from November 20th as a holdout.  
 

## GitHub & Collaboration Plan
The repository will include:  
- `data/` for datasets (with `.gitignore` to exclude large/raw data).  
- `notebooks/` for exploration and analysis.  
- `src/` for reusable code.  
- `docs/` for documentation.  

Proposal and final results will be submitted through this GitHub repository.

## How to reproduce:
- run make setup in the terminal. Will create a virtual environment. 
- Then run .venv\Scripts\activate
- run make enable-widgets
- run make notebook. This will open up the notebook server.

## Observations: ##
- The shape of the player count curve repeated in a daily basis, yet not in clicker games like Banana and Bongo Cat. The curve was totally unpredictable there, which is a reason to note whether it is a clicker game or not.
- For games released earlier in time, the player count curve was stable than games that were recently released.
