# Project Proposal

## Project Description
[Provide a clear description of the project.  
Example: We aim to predict student dining hall traffic using historical usage logs and weather data. This project will let us explore the relationship between environmental factors and student behavior.]

## Goals
- [State your goals clearly, e.g.: Build a predictive model for daily dining hall traffic.]
- [Identify key factors influencing the outcome.]
- [Develop a reproducible end-to-end data science pipeline.]

## Data Collection
- **Data Sources:** [List specific data sources, e.g., weather API, campus entry logs, survey data, Kaggle dataset.]
- **Collection Method:** [Explain how you will collect it: API calls, scraping, CSV downloads, surveys, etc.]
- **Frequency/Timeframe:** [Daily, hourly, weekly; historical vs. real-time.]

## Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies.  
- Normalize/standardize data formats (e.g., date/time, units).  
- Merge multiple sources into one dataset.  

## Feature Extraction
- Examples of features to extract:  
  - [Day of week, time of day, weather conditions, holidays, etc.]  
  - [Aggregated/engineered features like rolling averages.]  

## Modeling Plan
We will experiment with several approaches, including:  
- [Linear regression / logistic regression.]  
- [Decision trees or random forests.]  
- [Gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost.]  
- [Optional: Deep learning if time permits.]  

We will evaluate model performance and select the best one based on accuracy and interpretability.  

## Visualization Plan
- Exploratory plots (scatterplots, histograms, correlation heatmaps).  
- Time series plots to observe trends.  
- Feature importance plots (for tree-based models).  
- [Optional: Interactive plots using Plotly or Altair.]  

## Test Plan
- Reserve **20% of the dataset** as a holdout test set.  
- Use **k-fold cross-validation** on the training set to tune models.  
- Compare metrics such as [RMSE, accuracy, F1-score depending on the problem type].  

## GitHub & Collaboration Plan
- Repo will include:  
  - `data/` for datasets (with `.gitignore` for large/raw data).  
  - `notebooks/` for exploration and analysis.  
  - `src/` for reusable code.  
  - `docs/` for documentation.  
- Use **issues** and **pull requests** for collaboration and code review.  
- Submit proposal and final results through this GitHub repo.
